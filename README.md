## Welcome!
### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fcolanderos

**`Francisco Landeros`**  `Digital Process Specialist at INFORM Studio`  `M.Arch, B.S. Arch`

I am pursuing the integration and development 
of **Digital Technologies in Architecture**.

This repo serves as a way to contain current and developing
projects that focus on using computational tools.

I am mostly interested in the use of digital space as
a medium to explore and learn the world we know. 
Simulating the world can help architects ***truly*** design for the future.


### ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning/Using

`three.js`
I am working through [three.js](https://threejs-journey.com/)' journey
to adapt three-dimensional visualizations into more accessiblle media.

`C#`
is my primary programming language. I find it integratable to many uses 
and has helped me understand Object-Oriented Programming.

`python`
is my first learnt language. I moved beyond this to work with tools that are built using C#.

`Rhino/Grasshopper`
assists me in visualizing logic through 3D-modeled geometry.
Grasshopper is a great tool to start learning the basics of computational thinking.
